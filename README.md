# web-scraping
I wrote a script using axios, jsdom, excel4node and pdf4lib which scraps WorldCup 2019 scorecards from cricinfo and stores that in excel sheets and pdf form. The purpose of this project is to extract information of worldcup 2019 from cricinfo and present that in the form of excel and pdf scorecards
